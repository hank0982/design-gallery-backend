## Welcome to Design Gallery Backend

### Step 1 Clone the repo
  Check if you have NodeJS installed in your environment by type ```node --version``` in your terminal: current project is built in NodeJS >= v16.2.0. If not, please download NodeJS from https://nodejs.org/en/download/.
  
  After intstallation of NodeJS, run the following scripts to clone the repo and install the essential libraries.
  ```zsh
    git clone https://github.com/hank0982/design-gallery-backend.git
    cd design-gallery-backend
    npm i
  ```
### Step 2 Start a local web server
  Inside the project folder, run the following scripts to run a development server.
  ```zsh
    npm run start:dev
  ```
  Now go to https://localhost:3000/api and you will see the API documentation. Or go to https://localhost:3000 to see the pre-built frontend.
